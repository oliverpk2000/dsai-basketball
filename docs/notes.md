## Rebounds

offensive: if your teammate shoots and you get the ball

defensive if the other team shoots and you get the ball

## Assists
example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQmBPM18lIc

In basketball, an assist is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads directly to a score by field goal, meaning that they were "assisting" in the basket.

## Steals

taking the ball from the other team

## blocks
examples:
